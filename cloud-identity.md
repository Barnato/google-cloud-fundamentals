# Cloud Identity

* Using **Google Console** to manage cloud apps via gmail makes it hard to manage users e.g., what if someone leaves the organization...
* Team identity is not centrally managed.
* Should use **Google Admin Console** - use a tool called Cloud Identity. Can centrally manage policies and passwords in use in existing LDAP systems. 
* Cloud identity can also be used to manage mobile devices.
