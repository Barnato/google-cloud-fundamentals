# Open API

* GCP compatible with open source products

* Bigtable uses open source database Apache HBase, which gives customers the benefit of code portability.

* Another example, Cloud Dataproc offers the open source big data environment Hadoop, as a managed service.

 * Google publishes key elements of technology using open source licenses to create ecosystems that provide customers with options other than Google. For example, TensorFlow, an open source software library for machine learning developed inside Google, is at the heart of a strong open source ecosystem.
