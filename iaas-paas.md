# IAAS and PAAS

* The move to virtualization lead to two service offerings:  
    * Infrastructure as a service (IAAS):
        *  raw compute, networking, and storage
        * pay for resource allocation a head of time.

    * Platform as a service (PAAS):
        * bind code to libraries - resources focused on application logic.
        * pay for resources they actually use.
